The brain is something so complex and amazing that even today we are only just beginning to understand how it actually works. Because the 
brain is so complex, there is no single discipline or study that can even begin to unravel such a complex system. There is simply too much 
happening at once. This is the basis of interdisciplinary cognitive science and the Sloan Hexagon shown below.

Cognitive science is a way of bringing together the studies of many different branches and using the various skills and ideas present in
each one to understand the brain: an idea far beyond the comprehension of any one discipline. I find that this line of thinking 
is largely overlooked by computer scientists today. Obviously, a majority of my studies are disciplinary and focused on computer 
science, but I believe many of my most important skills, ideas, and perspectives come from my studies in other disciplines. All too 
often, there is a stigma that philosophy majors do not get jobs or that psychology is the field people go into when they do not know 
what they want to study or that a linguist is someone who knows alot of languages.

None of these statments are true. 

Rather, each one has its own contributions to the world, the Sloan Hexagon, cognitive science, and even computer science. AI is a booming 
field. Computational linguists are in more demand than ever. Philosphers invented logical thinking and anthropolgists use computational
tools to analyze the remains of social communities and networks. Just like the Sloan Hexagon shows, each discipline factors into the other,
even when it is not directly related to cognitive science. In every field, and especially computer science, problems extend beyond the scope of
one person or one field of study and require new perspectives, ideas, disciplines, and ways of thinking. This is why I believe in pursuing 
studies in addition to computer science, and why I tell people I do interdisciplinary work.
