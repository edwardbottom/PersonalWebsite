In this paper, I will evaluate the solutions to the puzzle of experience proposed by Anscombe and Valberg. I will begin the paper
by defining the puzzle of experience: how phenomenal conscious experience creates mental content and then addressing both the successes
and shortcomings of internalistic and externalistic responses to the puzzle. I will then present Anscombe’s intentionalism, which solves
the puzzle by equating the content and state of perception and Valberg’s critique of her solution. I will entertain Valberg’s problematic
reasoning and consider the implications of his existentialism in which he believes mental content is both internal and external, but will
ultimately reject his reasoning, embracing Anscombe’s solution for its more direct response to Valberg’s objections and the lack of 
foundation in Valberg’s response to the rejection of his problematic reasoning. 

Phenomenal consciousness experience is subjective, experiential mental content. It is the qualities of the experience that vary from
person to person based on senses and perspective: the way in which we describe our experience. This may be the way in which one describes 
a pain as sharp or blunt, stringing or throbbing. There is no way to quantify or physically observe such qualities as such details do not
physically manifest themselves within neurons and cannot be conceptualized or defined outside of individual experience. The puzzle of
experience is uncovering what defines the phenomenal conscious experience that makes up the mental content of experience. 

The most immediate response to this problem is that mental content is external, that the qualities of our experience are caused by their
external source. In this case, if one were to perceive a book, the contents of the experience would be tied to the external book that 
causes the content in one’s head. However, such a view fails to account for if someone were to be hallucinating the book. In that case, 
mental content exists without the external and thus cannot be caused by the external. Such a view seems absurd as it seems natural for the
external world to cause the contents of experience and if such an idea is true, the contents of our experience are confined to our minds
and we are unable understand the external world, solipsism. 

Anscombe responds to the puzzle of experience with a qualifying view known as intentionalism: the idea that the contents of our experience 
are representations of our external experience. Anscombe seeks to keep the transparency of externalism without falling into the trap of
hallucinations. By equating state and content through representations of the physical world, Anscombe can address the problem of 
hallucinations in that mental content is not directly caused by and equated with its external object, but rather the mind represents
mental content as the properties of its external experiences. In this case, hallucinations are the mind misrepresenting the external
world as it appears to the one perceiving the hallucination. 

Intentionalism seeks to avoid the puzzle of experience altogether by rejecting the duality of state and content. If one were to perceive
that a book is on a table, their mental content would not be the physical book itself, but rather the mind’s representations of the 
description of the book that is caused by the external experience of the book. It does not matter what the cause of the book is external
because the experience of the book is not tied directly to the externally existing book, but instead the representation of the book.
This view solves the puzzle of experience by making mental content about representations of the external when the external is present,
but uses misrepresentations to account for hallucinations, when external objects are not present.  

Valberg finds fault in Anscombe’s intentionalism, specifically that it fails to specify when the mind is representing internal or 
external content and that it presupposes experience and the content of experience are the same representation, trying to avoid the 
puzzle without answering it. Valberg believes that Anscombe is misinterpreting the puzzle from the start. If someone is to perceive 
“this book on the table”, the use of the demonstrative pronoun “this” implies that there is a thing in experience that one can 
demonstratively refer to that exists before and causes the representation that Anscombe believes is the content of mental experience.
If the “this” exists before the representation, as Valberg argues it does, then mental content cannot be a representation as the “this”
exists before the representation. Thus, intentionalism does not solve the puzzle of experience; it redefines the puzzle to defining the
demonstrative pronoun of experience that creates the representations of mental content. 

The externalist would respond to this problem by stating that the “this” of experience is an external object that causes the 
representation. However, Valberg gives a thought experiment, the problematic reasoning, in response to the externalist. In this 
experiment, Valberg considers one perceiving an object that exists in the external world, but then while perceiving it, the object
of experience disappears, but the observer’s experience continues. In the observer’s mind, the object is still there, but the external
object has disappeared. Valberg argues the “this” Anscombe refers to, the object of experience, has not changed despite the external 
stimuli disappearing and thus the object’s content could be defined by one’s internal experience.   

Valberg realizes that a purely internalistic view is inherently tied to solipsism and goes on to further define his position as an 
existentialist, one who believes mental content is internal but externally defined by “how things are in one’s experience”. He takes
a similar approach to Anscombe in that he embraces the externalist view and specific aspects of the internalist view, but believes that
the experiences of and the physical objects we perceive are distinct and that experiences should be categorized by the immediate 
awareness of the senses and not by unified representations.  Instead of trying to define the representations of mental content, Valberg
combines the transparency of externalism with the uncertainty of the problematic reasoning to form his view. 

 Valberg does not contest that when one directly perceives and experiences a book, the external book is the object of experience. He
 excepts such experiences as direct, but then draws upon the limits of reasoning to answer the problematic reasoning, arguing that the 
 internal is required to reason deeply about the object and further develop mental content and experience and to explain hallucinations
 that appear without a physical cause. The externalist and the intentionalist lack the ability to reason about experience indirectly,
 and do not consider the problematic reasoning, if the object became an internal hallucination. In using both external, direct reasoning
 and internal, indirect reasoning, Valberg directly addresses Anscombe’s inability to define the “this” of experience, while creating a
 view that addresses the problematic reasoning and maintains the transparency of externalism. 
 
 Valberg hinges the foundation of his beliefs on the problematic reasoning which is ironically problematic. The problematic reasoning 
 assumes that when the object is replaced with a hallucination, the content of experience remains the same. Valberg believes the mental
 content does not change due the persistence of reasoning in the internal before and after the object’s destruction. However, Valberg 
 gives no reason to believe that mental content does not change; he assumes that it does not in the argument’s premise. If the object 
 of experience were to change, as the externalist would argue it does, it is only logical that the contents of the experience should 
 change as well and then the problematic reasoning and as an extension Valberg’s beliefs no longer have a foundation.  
 
 If we reject the problematic reasoning, it entails that we can never be certain of object permanence. While this may seem 
 counterintuitive that objects can change at any time, it is a reasonable conclusion to Valberg’s problematic reasoning. Rather,
 by replacing objects with hallucinations at random, Valberg seems to imply that we should not be certain of an object’s continual 
 existence. 
 
 Valberg also claims that Anscombe incorrectly equates thinking to representation and thus looses the ability to reason about mental
 content and the object of experience, as deep reason is based around the indirect internal. I believe that Valberg is misinterpreting
 what a representation is. Representations are inherently a part of the internal and are not tied directly to the physical, but are the
 products of reasoning about descriptions of the external. In creating a mental representation of the external object, the mind reasons
 indirectly about external details to form a mental representation. Valberg suggests that Anscombe believes the representations in the
 mind are nothing more than mere representations of the external, but if that were true, then one would have to externally experience
 a hallucination or must have experienced the physical creation of the hallucination. However, a hallucination is not external and a 
 product of the internal mind’s reasoning about the descriptions of its prior external content, meaning that the mind is capable of 
 reason through representation. 
 
 I find Valberg’s critiques of Anscombe to be based on the incorrect assumptions that one cannot reason through representation, and 
 that the problematic reasoning is valid. Given internalism’s solipsistic nature, externalism’s inability to explain hallucinations,
 and Valberg’s invalid problematic reasoning, I believe Anscombe’s intentionalism most accurately models the mind’s phenomenal 
 conscious experience as it accounts for the transparency of the external and hallucinations without making mental content in part
 causally internal and relying on the problematic reasoning.
